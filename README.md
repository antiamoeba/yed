YED

Another old project. YED is short for Youtube for Education. It supports commenting and the like, with the focus on educational purposes. Was built mostly as a learning project for Calhacks 2015. YED evolved into Watchparty, which is currently under development and has shifted away from the educational focus.

server.js is the entry file. Sorry, somehow the package.json went missing so you might have to manually install dependencies.
